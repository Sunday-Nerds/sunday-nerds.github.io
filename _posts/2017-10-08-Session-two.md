### 2nd Firstday of Tarskah 1491DR
<br>
#### 9:30 - At Mhandyvver's chicken.

The party leaves Mhandyvver's chicken.
*Thog: "Now I've spent some time with you all and can see you are all of good character, I think it's time I told you what brought me to Red Larch. A map has come into my possession, which I'm told leads to treasure .... or certain doom."

Seafore asks to see the map, Thog tentatively hands it over.

*Seafore: "Where's the rest of it?"
"It's a fragment, that's all I have."

The party decide to make for Lance Rock, travelling south they pop into Vallivoe's for a second time. Seafore buys a healers kit (5gp), a wistle (5cp), 10x flasks of oil (50cp), a bell (1gp) and a mirror (3gp).

Once the transaction is finished, Vallivoe tells Casi about Feathergale spire where he has heard some nobels have a flying club.

Seafore inquires about chalk; there is no chalk.

It's 9:50 as they leave Red Larch travelling south on the long road.

At 12 they turn towards lance rock, which they can see in the distance to the west.

#### 14:00 - Lance rock.

There is a sign which warns of disfiguring disease.
The party are worried and Casi says Thog should shout a greeting to anyone who might be around.
*Thog shouts at the rock: "We're here to help you!"*
<br><br>
The rock doesn't reply.
<br><br>

They enter the cave, they see a dead guy on the floor and avoid him. Thog leads as they follow a passage though the rock. They can see a chamber with a large blood stained boulder in it. Casi and Seafore are keen to examine the boulder and rush forward to do so. A crate of rocks falls on them, taking Casi out and injuring Seafore. Two zombies jump down from a ledge which they have been hiding on above them.<br><br>

Thog positions himself between the fallen Casi and the second Zombie, hits with his war hammer. The zombie staggers but stays standing.
Varis delivers a immense looking kick to the side of the first Zombie's head, it looks dazed and heavily injured.
Seafore goes to stab the 1st zombie with his screwdriver, but fumbles and drops the screwdriver. He dives to the ground to recover it. 

Varis delivers a second equally powerful kick to Zombie one, leaving a disfiguring impact crater; zombie 1 is dead.

Zombie two lurches at thog with it's arms doing a little damage. Thog replies with a robust strike from his war hammer. Comabt ends.

A brief argument between Seafore and Thog ensures about who should get to heal Casi, after a brief to-and-fro it's decided Thogs healing hands would be better in this situation. Thog lays his healing hand on Casi. She awakes.

Seafore and Casi return to their investigation of the rock. *"Look!"* says seafore *"cutting marks, I think this has been used for some form of butchery."*

The party share ominous looks and move towards the left hand passageway. Travelling single file they come across 3 more zombies in a new chamber, and a battle ensues:

Seafore dives in lashing out at Zombie 1 with his screw driver. Then Casi unleashes an arrow at Zombie 3, making a resounding ***thunk*** . Thog follows Casi's attack with a lob from his war hammer; the zombie falls.

Varis lands a heavy handed attack on Zombie 2; it definately felt it but holds it's nerve.

Zombie 1 swings at Seafore but misses. Zombie two swings at Varis, injuring him.

Casi shoots Zombie 2, who appears to gasp for life ... well not life, but existence maybe, then rests eternally.

Seafore goes to stab zombie 1 and misses, zombie 1 swings at Seafore and misses, Varis ends the exchange with a heavy blow to zombie 1, zombie 1 strive to stay animate but ultimately fails.

Again our heros proceed by following the left passage. and after 8 meters enter a big lit chamber. There is much to see in here. 3 stone pliths with butchered bodies on them at the near end, then one more long stone table at the far end with various implements on it. A stair leads up the right cavern wall to a balcony. There is an exit at the far end. 4 skeletons are by the exit, a dark figure is by the table, another is at the nearest stone plith.

Varis leads the attack, hitting the nearest dark figure with a ultimately weak hit.

As he does a multitude of gastly animated hands emerge from the body on the table and scuttle towards the adventurers. One of them reached Thog and attempts an attack but is foiled by Thog's armour. Thog desponds with a might blow from the war hammer. The hand is no more.

Skeleton 1 starts to advance from the back of the room. Another hand moves to attack Seafore but misses. Seafore stabs at it with his screwdriver but misses.

The near by dark figure takes a swing at Varis but it's a miss.

A 3rd hand attacks Thog, again a miss.

Casi skillfully reaches over Seafore to skewer the hand on the ground in front of him, killing the hand.

Two more hands advance towards Thog and Varis. One of them lands a heavy scratching on Thog; it's surprisingly painful for the Paladin and he starts to worry. The Skeletons are on their way as well. The dark figure at the back of the room heckles the adventures.

*"Maybe we should retreat ... "* Says Thog.

Casi: *"What?!"*

*"This thing just gave me a scratch and it really hurts ... "*

Seafore: *"We can't retreat!"*

Thog: *"I mean, if any of you got strached that bad you'd probably be dead right now ... I don't think we're going to survive this ... "*

Varis: *"We are quite low on health ... "*

Seafore: *"We can't retreat!"*

Casi: *"Ok, I see your point, let's try to retreat."*

Our heros retreat down the passage, Thog blocking the fiends from following using his shield. They reach the chamber they had just left.

Casi: *"Can we rest here?"*

Thog: *"Are you mad?!"*

They retreat to the entrance of the cave.

Seafore: *"Let's smoke them out!"*

Varis: *"Would that work? Do they need air? I don't think the hands even had mouths ... "*

Thog: *"No ... Let's just go back to Red Larch and get some rest."*

Seafore: *"We'll come back tomorrow."*

Thog: *"We'll come back sometime."*

#### 18:15 They arrive at Red Larch and visit swinging sword.

They meet the land lady (veggie shred given them the mission), they're battered and brusied.

Kaylessia: *"What happened!"*

Casi: *"We went to that rock you told us about, turns out you've got neuromancers ... "*

Thog: *"We killed a bunch of them, but it's still pretty active there. We'll be going back to take care of it."*

Seafore: *"Tomorrow!"*

Kaylessia: *"Oh that's awful, thanks for looking into it, you do all look like you've had a rough few hours. Here, have some free lodging, ale, and food."*

The party retires to a table to nurse their wounds and eat their food.

Varis muses their predictament: *"Maybe we could recruit a group of passing adventures to clear out the caves for us."* our weary travellers are silent, perhaps in comtemplation, perhaps in exhaustion.
