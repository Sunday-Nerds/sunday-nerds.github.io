### 2nd Firstday of Tarskah 1491DR
<br>
#### 5:00 - At the raider camp

Our heros start early and take a closer look at the cave. Weapons drawn they discover no further dangers but (having universally decided to dispense of silver, electrum, and platinum) they 120gp and 140cp.<br><br>

They turn their attention to the Bear still mornfully trapped in it's cage and, having first retreated to a safe distance, they use Seafore's unseen helper hand thing to release the Bear. The Bear makes it's way to the corse of a fallen raider and starts to eat.<br><br>

The party makes to return to Red Larch.

#### 7:40 - Red larch: Vallivoe's sundries

Thog wants to get a map of the local area. The only store in town that looks likely is Vallivoe's so the party are there. Vallivoe does not have any maps but says he can arrange for one to be delivered. He believes he can do so for 16gp with a 5 day lead time but Thog declines this.<br><br>

Casi is asking Vallivoe about armed caravans that might have been coming through here, or if he knows of any Knights of Feathergale. Varrivoe says he is aware of neither but upon realising Casi is a also a Harper says he will endevour to use his contacts to find out more about the Knights of Feathergale.<br><br>

Seafore, enthused to meet another Harper, eagarly asks Varrivoe about fires. Varrivoe regards him with some concern but says there have been many cloaken figures at night for the last few weeks and maybe they are involved. He suggests asking more at the Helm at High Sun because it's a locals pub and therefore might be more likey to contain useful gossip.

#### 8:00 - Red larch: Allfaiths Shrine

Seafore and Varis are keen to visit the Shrine where they meet Lymmura who is a devotee of Sune. Seafore is enthusiastically asking about fire based religions, and Lymmura is claiming ignorance with increasingly thinly vailed irritation. Finally, in desperation, she mentions a Haunted Tomb which might somehow be involved; and sends Seafore in the direction of Minthra's Poultry.
Lymmura, tries to send Mike to Haunted Tomb.

#### 9:00 - The Helm at High Sun

Our heros burst into the pub well before it's due to be open and interrogate the barman Garlen whose politeness gives way to mild agression before he's successful in shooing them off.

#### 9:15 - Mhandyvver's Poultry

Minthra successfully sells Seafore a chicken and her daughter Minny comes over to describes the location of a Haunted Tomb
