### 1st Tenday of Tarsakh 1491DR

#### 17:30 - The party encounter a small band of raiders outside a cave entrance

Safely out of sight of the bandits our adventures observe the camp. They see two raiders sat buy the fire merrily drinking and eating. One raider appears to be on watch, another is fiddling with a cart. Atop the cart is a caged Black Bear.
<br>
<br>

After some discussion our party hatch a plan:

* Casi and Seafore shall sneak forward to get a better look and possibly launch a sneak attack as both are well suited to stealth in this terrain.
* Thog and Varis will wait out of sight but keep watch and charge when the action starts.


Seafore makes a Motalov cocktail using a bottle, some oil, and some material from Thogs tunic. He gives the Motalov cocktail to Thog.


#### 17:40

Seafore &  Casi sneak up to bandits, they get within 55ft.

They discuss releasing the bear, but ultimately decide to use the camp fire as a weapon. Casi successfully sneaks into position behind the cart. Seafore casts unseen hand and uses it to throw a bucket of oil through the camp fire towards the raiders.
<br><br>

Raider2 successfuly avoids the fire but Raider1 takes damage. Using the distraction to her advantage, Casi back stabs Raider3 (who was by the cart) who is visible hurt by the attack. Varis rushes over to Raider4 who was on guard.
<br><br>

The Raiders manage to compose themselves, having avoided the flames, Raider2 shoots Varis with a crossbow doing significant damage, Raider1 also shoots but misses Varis. Thog rushes to Raider1. Raider4 swings his sword and deals a deathly blow to Varis, Varis falls.
<br><br>

Seeing Varis fall, Seafore cast a fire ball but misses critically and burns himself in the process.
<br><br>

Meanwhile behind the cart Casi stab Raider3 with a rapier, killing him.
<br><br>

Having recovered from his earlier attempt Seafore unleashes a second fire ball, hitting Raider4 and doing some damage.
<br><br>

By the camp fire; Raider1, Raider2, and Thog are sparing. Both Raider1 and Raider2 swing their swords at the Paladin and both miss.<br><Br>

As this is happening Raider4 raises his crossbow and return fire to Seafore, hitting him.<br><br>

At the camp fire: Casi has joined the fray. She stabs Raider1 and he falls to the ground. Thog deals Raider2 a heavy blow with his sword.<br><br>

The deadly Raider4 unleashes a second crossbow bolt at Seafore, hitting him. Seafore falls to the ground.<br><br>

Casi slices at Raider2, killing him. Thog makes a run-and-lunge at Raider4, it makes contact and Raider4 is killed. The ordeal is over<br><br>

#### 17:45

Thog tends to Varis and Seafore in turn, returning them from deaths door. Though both are still weak. As he does Casi sneaks over to the mouth of the cave and quickly peers round the corner, perhaps checking for more raiders? She finds none.<br><br>

Though still wounded himself, Varis tends to Seafore and his own wounds.<br><br>

The party discuss returning to Red Larch but ultimately decide they feel safe enough at the Raider camp to spend the night there. They seat the remains of the Raiders Boar Stew and drink their Ale before taking it turns to keep watch.
