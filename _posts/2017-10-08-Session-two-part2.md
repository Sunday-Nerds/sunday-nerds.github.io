Two more hands advance towards Thog and Varis. One of them lands a heavy scratching on Thog; it's surprisingly painful for the Paladin and he starts to worry. The Skeletons are on their way as well. The dark figure at the back of the room heckles the adventures.

*"Maybe we should retreat ... "* Says Thog.

Casi: *"What?!"*

*"This thing just gave me a scratch and it really hurts ... "*

Seafore: *"We can't retreat!"*

Thog: *"I mean, if any of you got strached that bad you'd probably be dead right now ... I don't think we're going to survive this ... "*

Varis: *"We are quite low on health ... "*

Seafore: *"We can't retreat!"*

Casi: *"Ok, I see your point, let's try to retreat."*

Our heros retreat down the passage, Thog blocking the fiends from following using his shield. They reach the chamber they had just left.

Casi: *"Can we rest here?"*

Thog: *"Are you mad?!"*

They retreat to the entrance of the cave.

Seafore: *"Let's smoke them out!"*

Varis: *"Would that work? Do they need air? I don't think the hands even had mouths ... "*

Thog: *"No ... Let's just go back to Red Larch and get some rest."*

Seafore: *"We'll come back tomorrow."*

Thog: *"We'll come back sometime."*

#### 18:15 They arrive at Red Larch and visit swinging sword.

They meet the land lady (veggie shred given them the mission), they're battered and brusied.

Kaylessia: *"What happened!"*

Casi: *"We went to that rock you told us about, turns out you've got neuromancers ... "*

Thog: *"We killed a bunch of them, but it's still pretty active there. We'll be going back to take care of it."*

Seafore: *"Tomorrow!"*

Kaylessia: *"Oh that's awful, thanks for looking into it, you do all look like you've had a rough few hours. Here, have some free lodging, ale, and food."*

The party retires to a table to nurse their wounds and eat their food.

Varis muses their predictament: *"Maybe we could recruit a group of passing adventures to clear out the caves for us."* our weary travellers are silent, perhaps in comtemplation, perhaps in exhaustion.
